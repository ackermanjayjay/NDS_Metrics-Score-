# NDS_Metrics-Score-

# Objective
* Using data [News Dataset BBC](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/bbc-news) from 2013 to 2024. 
* Comparing (similiarity) two NDS  with metrics.
* Find higher scoring queries that are most similar to news headlines.

# Scope
* Techique embedding data  with TFIDF and Counvectorizer( Bag of word )
* Find query beetween NDS to find higher similiarity

# How to use
<pre>
pip venv "you name venv"
pip install requirements.txt
</pre>
